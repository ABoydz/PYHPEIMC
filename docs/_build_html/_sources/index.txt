HPE PYHPEIMC PYTHON SDK
====================================

Introduction
============

This library was built to simplify working with the HPE Intelligent Management Center Network Management
System RESTful API.

Rather than to have network developers worry
about the underlying REST API, this library provides a means to
manage HPE IMC functions through pre-built Python objects that make it
extremely easy to get started programming in an HPE environment.
